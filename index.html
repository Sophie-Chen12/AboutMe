    <h3> Favorite thing to do during quarantine</h3>
    <p> I have now perfected the art of afternoon naps in my new quarantine
      life. Before this I have never taken a nap as they always make me feel
      worse. Now I know the perfect amount of time I can sleep to feel the
      perfect amount of refreshness: 2hrs and 15min.</p>
